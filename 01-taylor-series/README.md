# Taylor Series Approximation

This project demonstrates numerical approximation of elementary functions
using classical numerical methods.

## Implemented methods
- Approximation of cosine using Taylor series
- Approximation of arctangent using Taylor series
- Approximation of square root using Heron's method

## Description
The program compares exact values of functions with their numerical
approximations and evaluates the approximation error.

## Build and run
From the `src` directory:

```bash
clang++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main
./main
